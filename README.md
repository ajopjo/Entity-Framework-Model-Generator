# Entity-Framework-Model-Generator
Visual Studio extension package for generating data model from Data Context Class

##Release Notes

Entity framework powertools is not working for VS 2015 and I always want to see the data model diagram generated from code first migrations.
This VS extension provide a menu item to generate Data Model from a context class. The requirement is that the DataContext class name ends with DataContext
