# Entity-Framework-Model-Generator

Entity framework powertools is not working for VS 2015 and I always want to see the data model diagram generated from code first migrations.
This VS extension provide a menu item to generate Data Model from a context class. The requirement is that the DataContext class name ends with DataContext

09/09/2017 update - The menu item will be available on a class that inherits from DbContext class.
